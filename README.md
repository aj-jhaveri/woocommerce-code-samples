WooCommerce Modifications Plugin

Created using the WooCommerce-Plugin-Extension-Boilerplate (https://github.com/ViLourenco/WooCommerce-Plugin-Extension-Boilerplate).

This is a simple plugin that demonstrates the use of WooCommerce Actions and Filter Hooks (which can be found at https://docs.woocommerce.com/wc-apidocs/hook-docs.html) to make programmatic changes to a WooCommerce enabled site without the use of template overrides or your theme's functions file.

Features:

1) Removes rating from woocommerce single product summary (woocommerce_template_single_rating)
2) Replaces sale flash text with price savings (woocommerce_sale_flash)
3) Adds content after single product summary (woocommerce_after_single_product_summary)
4) Renames "home" in breadcrumb (woocommerce_breadcrumb_defaults)

There are two versions, one with boilerplate functionality for plugin activation/deactivation and localization (WooCommerce-Modifications-old) and a lean version (WooCommerce-Modifications).  


The lean version of this plugin has been uploaded and can be viewed in action on my server at https://slakedesign.com/blog/product/logo-t-shirt/
